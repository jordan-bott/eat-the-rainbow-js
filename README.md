# Welcome to Eat the Rainbow!

#### This is a frontend-only project built in Javascript/React. I've used Tailwind as my CSS framework, and Vite to start up the project.

Eat the Rainbow is a webpage designed to help you eat at least one fruit or vegetable of each color each day. This is an informational webpage using information found from [Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/phytonutrients-paint-your-plate-with-the-colors-of-the-rainbow-2019042516501). Clicking on any fruit/vegetable will "add" to their list to see if they have a fruit/veggie from each color in their meal plan.

##### Future features:

- Adding phytonutrient information
- Allowing users to input other fruits/vegetables not listed
