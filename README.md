## Welcome to Eat the Rainbow!

#### This is a quick frontend-only project built in Javascript/React. I've used Tailwind as my CSS framework, and Vite to start up the project.

Eat the Rainbow is a webpage designed to help you eat one fruit or vegetable of each color each day. This is an informational webpage using nutrition information found from the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/nutrition-information-raw-fruits-vegetables-and-fish). Clicking on any fruit/vegetable will "add" to their list to see if they have a fruit/veggie from each color in their meal plan.

⚠️ This is an _in progress_ project, please check back for updates! ⚠️
